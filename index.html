             <p>If we are ever to sit and count our blessings, we would not be able to ignore the importance a teacher has or had in our lives. Teachers are also often compared to the building blocks of our society who help us lay a firm foundation of knowledge and wisdom, on which we further build our lives and career. This esteemed profession is often counted as one of the most respectable, among others because it is the teachers who work in othersâ€™ growth. Someone can also be a teacher by nature and not by profession for having personality qualities like enriching others with knowledge and guiding them.
